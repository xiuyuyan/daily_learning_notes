有一位演员的名字相信你或多或少都听说过，他以实拍和各类特技动作而闻名，他就是汤姆克鲁斯，而他主演的碟中谍系列，我相信你也应该很喜欢对吧？扒飞机、爬迪拜塔、高空跳伞，有各种惊险刺激的名场面。那这一次受到B站和派拉蒙的邀请，我们前往了伦敦碟中谍8最终清算的水印里。有幸我们采访到了阿汤哥。虽然因为时间紧迫，我们能问的问题有限，但是阿汤哥还是给了不少有意思的回答，也你也会感兴趣，所以说话不多说，我们直接开始。
Adam, I never saw it will be possible, but it's a great honor to meet you in person.
Thank you for me too. It's an honor to meet you before we actually .
start with questions. We have something special for you. We want to share some appreciate to mission impossible to you and the cruise. It's handcrafted immediately. sad.
Hey, that is beautiful.
And if there's no twist, it's not mission possible. So there's always a twist. This thing actually corresponding to the new film and is very cool. So no, you recover.
Wow, wow, wow.
Hope you like it.
Do you hope I like it? I love it. And I am very honored that you did that.
Look at the work involved in that. It's phenomenal. Thank you so much. That's gonna go into my office.
Okay, now we're going to jump into a crash. Okay, let's go. right. So the first question we're gonna throw to you is doing everything, live action, which one is the most chAllenging to you from the acting?
I must tell you, at that time when I did it, they were the most chAllenging until we kind of evolve and we do the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one. So we keep increasing the chAllenges. If you look at my career, you can see my first aerial sequence that I did was in top gun in nineteen eighty five.
Then I fly jets, I fly airplanes, I fly aerobatic airplanes, I fly perished. you. I learn all of these skills, and then I apply the skills to the movie. I studied aerial sequence, and I developed area of photography for years.
We're inventing knowledge. We watched the film. Obviously.
the by playing part is incredible. What is like the technical chAllenge for the biplane part?
It's incredible. It's numerous. You know because i'm i'm an aerobatic pilot.
There's so many elements of how much power to use on the engine, the different maneuvers that we're doing, how do we put the cameras in different places, what's the air flow gonna be like over the cameras? How much power is coming off the propeller? The air molecules coming off the tips of these propellers is traveling at the speed of sound? I don't know if you've ever driven in a card one hundred and forty five miles an hour and stuck your face out, you can't breathe. So there's technically things that i'm having to do to prepare my body to be able to breathe and the amount of testing that I do to get it to where you're seeing, what you're seeing. So all of these things are coming .
into play and above focus. Obviously, in the film, there's a lot of folks of racking yeah to amplify the emotion, you back and forth doing action. How do you come to the focus?
That's a very good question. You have to understand i'm flying the airplane noise. And when you see the focus, go from the wing to my closeup.
Where's the focus puller? Yeah, I was. It's me.
You are pulling the folk i'm pulling.
I'm acting flying the airplane and i'm pulling focus.
That's unbelievable. Yes, you're literally cook.
Eventually i'm flying with my throttle and i'm literally pulling focus while I have the stick in my hand oh my god. So I know frame wise how long it needs to be on the far shut. And then I come back and i'm racking focus to my close up. My god.
that is the same thing. I never heard an actor on an airplane and racking focus because .
no one's ever done before.
And for the underwater shops, how do you see yourself? Do you guys have an underwood monitors .
on mccue was underwater with me. We did hand signals so he would drive, and we'd worked together. We spent years developing the masks so that it looks cinematic.
Do you scuba dive at all? Oh yeah.
This is. What does it? Okay, okay. You have the regulator. Yeah, i'm now in an open face mask, so I breathe in the oxygen, but now my carbon dioxide is trapped inside the mask.
How do you think it out exactly?
I'm absorbing carbon dioxide of retirements. This suit i'm wearing weighs one hundred and twenty five pounds when it's wet and i'm moving through the film and i'm pulling myself up, that's the extra weight on Carrying, which creates more carbon dioxide than i'm breathing out. So I would have to flush it in between takes because I couldn't have the regulator.
It wasn't the story that Mickey and I wanted to tell. So we spent time developing the mass that looks cinematic. Now I have the lights inside the mask so I can't see.
The reflection is very hard. Now i'm moving in a massive set and its rotating, and you have particles and shelves and missiles and things that can crush me. Now I can't see.
So I have to spend a lot of time in it knowing everything that moves as i'm doing it and feeling it as i'm going along. Even if you see me on a motorcycle, i'm actually directing or on a plane or anything and it's close. I'm i'm keeping the distance so I have to act and know where that is and if I and not hit it and have them not hit me .
so you know exact timing forever.
I can feel it. I perceive it. I don't know how to say it, but I perceive it.
That is incredible.
It's wild. It's wild.
And this time, obviously, it is to shut on imax cameras, right? Which part is like shot on the big imax camera? And you can see the big .
action and all, you know this scale that we have, that's where we're shooting. We're shooting it. Didn't those formats for the audience? I've been someone who pushed the big format since the beginning of my career.
I developed a sixty five millimeter camera that we shot on foreign away. So i've always wanted that kind of experience. I love that as an audience member.
I want that big scale. I have the sound. You know, we spend a tremendous amount of time working on all of these elements.
I wanna talk to come about a song. Actually, I think people sometimes are missing out about importance of following at some design. Yeah, mind to address on that.
Yeah definitely. You know we spend a lot of time working on these sequences and you hear even in top gun maverick, it's not the sound of the jet, the amount of layers that we have for the engine, sound to have that audience feel the pressure of that base and create sounds that immerse an audience into an environment. And it also has to go along with our music, you know, when they hear the entity talk. And if you hear at the theatres where we place those sounds to make it immersive for an audience.
like every single punch, like so powerful is this.
yeah you know, the underwater sequence where you're feeling the metal bend. We want the audience to feel like they're in that submarine when we choose to have the music. So that immersive for the audience, they feel a subjective character experience. They're there with Ethan, not just watching him, but feeling for him and with him.
I know obviously in the entity world, you know the ai and everything is perfect and they can replicate anything. One question I have for you is why doing everything in live action? Why not, you know have the ai generating stuff.
There's things that when we're doing things practically, you know how people will do it in an animated now like we kinda do an animate and they do it when you're dealing with live people and live things. There's surprises that are just it's there, it's alive. It has a different emotional value, things that you don't expect.
Those are the things that i'm looking for when we're making movies. And the beauty of making movies is that human element. The beauty of life is the human element.
Okay, alright.
thank you much. Thank you again for this.
Yeah.
this is for you. Thank you. And please, thank, thank your whole crew. Thank the whole crew for doing that.
能和阿汤哥一起了解这些特技实拍的幕后真的非常难得。我们之前访谈过他的高空跳伞，就非常能明白这些极限挑战的背后就是完美的努力还有热爱。那就像阿汤哥所说的，电影的美源于友人的创造，这也是我们同样在追求的方向。所以如果你觉得这个节目对你有帮助的话，欢迎给我们点赞。图片三人转发。那碟中谍八也会在5月30号在国内上映，有兴趣的朋友可以去看一看，或者也可以点开P2看看我们在首页里红毯之上对导演和其他主演的模块采访。我们下次见。
