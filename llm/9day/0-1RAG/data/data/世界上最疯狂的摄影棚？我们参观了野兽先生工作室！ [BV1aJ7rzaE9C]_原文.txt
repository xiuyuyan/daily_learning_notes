世界上最疯狂的摄影棚？我们参观了野兽先生工作室！ [BV1aJ7rzaE9C]_原文
虽然这个楼看着平平无奇，但是你敢想象这里面有着世界上关注量最高的频道之一。他总共有八个亿的粉丝，比我们还要高好几个量级。他们的营收各方面都会被我们强省很多。这就是非常知名的mr miss野兽先生，美国全网第一网红，这一次我们会带你来看看。
他的工作室到底是什么样的。
这样一家500个人比我们再大三倍的公司是如何运作的。比如你看这是他们的吉尼斯记录墙，光是拍一期节目他们就能产生四十多个吉尼斯记录，超级离谱。这个视频和正常会稍微有点不一样。这次我想带着你一起通过更慢的节奏来看看miss piece这家公司到底是怎么运作的。本质上我们和他们确实有些相似之处，但是确实他们很多地方都比较先进。所以这次我会更多以第一人称的视角，毕竟我也是第一次见我们共同以一个学生的身份来看看他们这家公司怎么样。
This is where we build all our sets. Go on on inside, you can head in. okay? Is where we build, uh, any video you see on the main channel with a big set, it's in here.
Yeah, the the last video we filmed, we had the world's best sumo wrestler over here, noise and a real bear. So in this circle was the number one summer wrestler on the planet, and that circle was a bear. And then to win a hundred grand, do you have to spend a minute in one of the circles?
This is where we build a lot of our sets. Um the if you look up, you'll see over a hundred sprinklers and here you'll see them kind of sticking out so you can shoot, can do a lot of bombs that explode and things like that. So we have sprinklers that can put out the fires, so you're more likely to drown here than you are to burn down the building.
Okay, that's that's the thing because we do a lot of crazy videos um and then if we keep coming so uh, we have people sorting money over here. I don't don't disturb it and don't ask questions you don't want to know the answer for, but yes, these are people that are counting the money that we give away. Like if you look in here, these are just trash bags full of money.
Okay, okay. So this is where we get the money we give away in the videos. I like to use money where it's like big piles, but then afterwards we have to adapt to then sort it through and restock them into bills like these. So this is like the aftermath we don't Normally .
show on camera. 这个时候你一定很好奇，这么多现金到底是真的还是假的？那答案就是我现场替你看了。这些钱确实是假的，但是这些假钱他们是用在有任何爆炸或者落水场景的项目里面，真正结算的时候，那就是真的。一箱箱的美金给到了参赛者。不过别看他们每次奖金体量那么大，他们的营收是非常恐怖。
Mr bees告诉我们，他们公司总共有500人，其中200人左右是做内容，剩下300人左右是不同的财务团队，还有非常著名的巧克力，还有他们的周边团队。这个团队非常厉害，给他们贡献了很大一部分的营收。他们公司的人员规模是我们的三倍，但是营收却是我们的几十倍甚至百倍，这是非常夸张的一个数据，有了这么多营收，他们当然也有了更多的资源来做更多离谱的事情。比如说Jimmy就单独带我看了一下他们的设备库。
第一次so over here is a server racks。When we do like two hundred contestant videos, and we set up like a camera in each circle or whatever, you could throw footage. These are where all the feeds go into so you can monitor hundreds of contestants in one spot, all the animals once.
And how much data do you generate per like the contestant videos and many petabytes, petabytes, right? We're talking about millions of gigabytes, yes. Yeah, definitely petabytes.
Like these kids, absolutely, I think was like one point five petabytes over here. These are awesome. So whenever we're in a video, yeah so these PTZ, we compare with these.
And then you can use these to like, zoom in and zoom in and zoom out on people in the circus, because the contestants, we can on the fly, adjust the cameras remotely. Wait, this is just casually laying down so much cameras randomly. Yeah, I mean, we got too many.
They're collecting dust.
Wait, what's wrong with the dust Jimmy put on ebay? Please let me see it. My brand new.
Uh, in here we've got hundreds of go pro. Oh my god. And tube lies.
This is a very expensive. The quays up, the quasar one, the titan tubes. Yeah, I love titan tubes. Yeah, I love titan tubes. And then we also even is really scifi looking.
So you turn on and .
these delights, Jimmy loves these things. Yeah, these are great. You wanna hold it while you walk around? Yeah, here you got it.
There you go, I tell us, is the lighting matter. This is our standard camera that we have. This is our standard camera that we use for pretty much every shoot that we do.
And it's super versatile of reliable and really good. We also use the toyota system as well. Yeah, we love tells us we were really good friends with the ceo.
We even have this inspire three. They inspire three. You know, we crashed ten of them, you know, a company, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Single year will crush townsville. I'm not lying, Nancy tells even .
for me that's like they just crossed noise.
They just crossed yesterday, like one dropped into indian ideas. And then over here, how honestly, at this point, he should just take over the tory. He knows more about my camera gear than me, is it?
All right, guys, there is a very unique ones. This one is not selling, selling anymore because the company goes bankrupt. Oh, really, yeah, they died.
So ah they even know that I got a relic. It's a shame. Okay, you gotta, you got a rare ones and you got AF, F, X, X, X, X, the G, O, P, R, O, S.
What the you guys got so much?
Go for scores. Yeah, we use a lot of go for us because there's two thousand on the on beef games. We use over a thousand.
okay? Yeah, that's a souvenir. You can take it home. Okay, there you go. There you go way.
If go pro goes out of socks, they should come to here. Oh yeah. I mean, we're keeping them alive, to be honest. They're in the record of the numbers because we buy so many.
确实这个资金体量的不同时，他们能做的事和我们就是不一样的。除了庞大的设备库，他们会给员工画200万美金造这样一个篮球场，这也是我非常羡慕的一点。更离谱的是因为这些地全部是他们买下来的，总共买了40万平方米的地，所以他们想建任何东西都可以。他们在篮球馆的另一边花了2点三四亿人民币，建了一个全身学处理的一个巨大的拍摄棚，来制作下一季的beast电影节目。
There's no echo. So we build really large sets. And typically, buildings this large have a lot of beams, support beams. This has no support beams. So you can actually build a set that stretches from one side to the other, which is not possible in a typical warehouse. So that's what makes it very expensive.
Because what usually makes it cheap is you just slap a roof on a bunch of support beings, but to build it without any support down the middle like this like no one does that it's the largest sound stage in north america, the largest yeah without consecutive beam, which for us we need because of again, large sets. So crazy, we're just getting started. Keep all of you.
okay. All right. So you're see videos we currently have in progress. One of them, we took a guy that one of my friends that wanted to lose weight, and I told him if he lost a hundred pounds before he left a circle, I would give him three hundred thousand dollars. So in your guys currency, two point four million dollars.
And then the other video we're gonna check out, I built a prison. I grabbed a guy who spent years in federal prison. And then a cop, I told him that they lived together in the prison for a hundred days.
They'd win half a million dollars. So they're on like day fifty seven. Yeah, alright.
So we'll go check out on the guy doing weight loss. He hasn't left this circle in six months. Oh my god.
Oh my god. How often do you come to check him every other day? Okay, you're nice.
what? I'm in town, if i'm not in town? noise.
So yeah, everyone, if you come over here, you'll see this. All right? So this is the red circle.
And once he stepped inside this circle, if he steps on it before he loses a hundred pounds, he gets nothing. That's a gym filled with workout gear. Everything he can need is inside of it.
Six months ago, he stepped in here. We wait em and then he can't leave until that numbers says one hundred pounds less. Yeah, so I can check it.
So this is the control room where you'll see all the cameras. Uh, wow. So hello, guys, come on it.
Come on it. wow. So these are all the cameras. We have monitoring them. We have over a couple dozen cameras running twenty four seven recording everything. We also have cameras recording the line so we'll know if he leaves.
Uh, so I can assure you he has not left since the chAllenge started because we're tracking the lines twenty four seven and then we have people on rotating shifts monitoring him. So these two, how how long have you been watching him today? Yeah, twelve hours.
So they're about twelve hours into monitoring. Yeah, today's a day, one hundred and fifty three. And now we'll go back out that door until the left and we'll go ahead and say, hi, wow. yeah.
How many cameras are here? Do you mean twenty four cameras? crazy. Well, the Price is crazy.
太帅了。这比我们要先进太多。All right, everybody, come on inside.
wow. Knock, knock. I bring friends. Welcome aside. So this is a set that we built just for this video. So this exists just for this video. Imagine I brought a lot of friends with cameras, kind of that there's a match, everyone, gonna sculpture to see you.
That's me. Sorry, my heads.
Okay, so they they probably have a lot of questions, but to start off explain what's going on.
So I started out of my way, yeah, go home. So i'm done seventy one pounds from three twenty four. So I started at three hundred twenty four pounds.
Noise, two hundred fifty three pounds. So in the last five months, yeah so um right now so every thirty days Jimmy gives me a chAllenge. So i'll work out forward a week and then i'll have two cardio days on one full rest day. But for this chAllenge i'm practicing straight grip .
straight so on day one sixty every second he can hang. I will add a thousand dollars to the Price pool yeah and then before I gave him a thousand dollars for every push up he could do. And so every thirty days there's a new chAllenge you can do to add more money to surprise full. That's why the Price pulls three hundred and forty six grand because he keeps wanting more money. But that's only if he loses one hundred pounds does he get.
We're gluten close.
We're going to close. Yeah, you wanna show them around.
I haven't even shown him .
your remembrance. She'll the crab.
Sorry guys. sorry.
wow. So that's my beautiful kitchen.
We got everything we need.
right? Yeah correct.
We got out my bedroom over here so I get wait every single day. I just don't know my weight until Jimmy gives it to me every thirty days. So scale I step on as yeah, it was not my bedroom. It's nothing too crazy guys, I suppose.
but it didn't do all these days because it is lonely. Um I mean, I mean.
it definitely definitely is a little chAllenging because you're trying to build these new habits and routines, especially for someone that never did this before in their entire life. I never know how to cook, and my coach taught me how to cook.
We have a grocery story. Wow, a grocery stole. Yeah.
so you don't have to cook. No, I learned it. Oh yeah.
You have to go. Oh no. You cook and see you. Oh, no.
So this is going to be stopped up in three days. So anything I need? So I wanted a steak. I could get a steak. I cook.
Does that cost you money? noise. Do they charge you? Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.
oh. He gets on limited lunch late too, by the way. Okay, you guys need.
you guys want to watch. You guys are more than one minute.
Do, uh, do people build big sets like these for videos on Billy? Billy, not really, not really. I'm gonna learn from you.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you think you're thinking we're going to you're thinking and we, uh, you can win the game. Oh yeah, you can see this point.
I'm too invested. You'd Better not quit. Oh, there's another cool thing. So it's not on right now. But sometimes what i'm traveling right when I did a hundred hours at the pyramid, or i'm doing a video in a different country, this is a hologram machine anywhere in the world. I can stand in front of a White background, put a camera on a tripod, and then i'll hologram me in here. And it looks like him in the room so I could do a check in with him.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It would literally be a live feet. So it would be him. And then me and he'd be able to see me.
So that's a cool farm that's probably spend your money. So that right there allows me to talk to them and interact with them. And then this will be like a hologram of me.
Yeah, it's very cool. And then married, you wanna show them outside? Wow image.
One of the bad. yeah. So this is his court.
my basketball court, my recovery station. I got a sauna at a cold point. wow.
yeah. Paid for staying here for three months. Yeah, you are paying nothing.
Nothing at all. I have fifteen basketball. If you guys look out there, I have failed to .
sometimes several times and .
I can't get to the .
funny part is we could go get them, but it's funnier if we don't we don't know. Oh, so mean, do you mean you know how to go show them? The prison set over there.
Are you guys gonna have a lot of fun there.
Do you watch them? Can, can, can see them? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay, hold on, hold on. Get a look. You can get a little closer.
Now that's like, this is good. Ah.
okay. So just for reference, if he stepped here, he'd lose around two point four million dollars in your guys'currency. Wow, noise.
Just one step. And if you touched it, the video is over. It's done and .
I can go home.
Oh, no.
shut ever.
I mean, these are some of the biggest creators in china. Like, if you ever leave, now would be the, yeah, you got violence and do it again.
But in china.
yeah, we do it. In china, then you got it with two point four, I guess. Yeah, okay, jokes aside, get out of you.
go. Thank you. Thank you. Bye, bye, bye. Enjoy your workout. The hobbit of prison.
Yes, now the prisoners, you can actually see, they get an hour in the yard every day. And we just like their yard times right now. Oh my god, that's crazy.
So the sets are so close to each other. So I film with him, and then I walk over here and I film with the prisoners. Wow oh.
以前MCB4的节目经常会到世界各地去拍，但是到后面他们发现还是把人给运过来，只是在公司附近建设拍摄场地是最高效的方式，所以就出现了这么一个奇观，你隔着几百米的地方，就会有人被关在截然不同的场景里面生活。甚至为了能够更高效的把明星运过来，他们还在建设一条机场跑道，飞机落地之后就能直接开拍。
Oh, my god, this is why no one visits you guys. I know. So who is the prisoner, sir? Let me see who is nicer.
yeah. Yeah, the prisoner, here we go. Yeah, I wasn't about fifty grand for whoever could smuggle us. I will do so. Yeah, you guys want to tell me your .
story a little bit. yeah. Uh, so me. I was a detective in the new york city in nypd for seventeen years.
Wow, wow.
yeah. And I decided to leave to spend more time with my family and do some more things that were a lot of my purpose. And, uh, this just happens to be one of them.
So I went to federal prison when I was twenty one for, uh for three years for fraud relating the concert production and nightclub a stone uh, okay, I mean, to open up a software. Okay, okay. So here's uh, someone who did something bad but has reformed and you know is is pretty chill and here's a cop.
Let's see how they do together for a hundred days in prison. What day is the other day? Fifty eight, fifty eight? Let's let's go.
Let's go inside. We think of each other. 什么感觉？太帅了。Crazy, crazy. Yes, 他们是怎么想到这种，就是他主要真的还能造个监狱出来，这太离谱了，这主要是他还是真的找不到。Oh, no, he's opening the door, and we are welcome to the prison.
Not that that this part section off don't worry, it's over here and he's a design based on a real yeah you'll see when you get inside all right. So these are all remote controlled um so okay, just unlocked. Come on over here.
Okay, and then follow me up. Come on up, okay, come on in. come.
All right, hello, all right. Come on and everybody. I wow. So this is the control room.
This is where we monitor all the prisoners, prisoners, the prison cells over there, here. And then open those stores right there. You can see the actual inside of the prison.
So ahead on it. Wow, how much time this man sells everything? They only get an hour outside.
So twenty three hours outside. Yeah, twenty three hours inside. It's like a real prison.
Yeah, you get an hour of your time. That's true. Yeah, this is real. Why they want to get to spend one hour outside the rest of the每天只能1个小时出来，我的天哪，他们用的是什么？
都是索尼的FR7遥控摄影机。然后他们后端有所有的。
这些遥控云台。
然后就是说这一套方案也有4K120帧的录制能力。然后他们室内布置了这么多，每一台索尼FR7大概价值35000块钱.
然后他们外面部署了很多PTZ相机。I think they're gonna. Oh, is this what it's like? Noise, noise, noise. It's definitely. It's crazy being done. Yeah, yeah.
it's a .
sensitive .
topic. This is a countdown you do every morning.
Wow, forty two.
So if you collect the other sources, and then in the morning you do a little countdown. No phones and electronics, no connection with the outside world at all.
There's different levels in real prison. But like at the camp, the last spot I was up, I would be like the runner, so I would leave the person and go and grab like mcDonald's lamp, trying to see what we all had, cell phones we were watching like oranges to be black on our but it's all illegal, granted. But here he runs up to type chip. He kicked any noise. So basically everything he doesn't like about my person is because we follow.
I don't know what wanky .
janki prison you're in, but here we follow state, federal rules. This solitaire is emphasize of a real solid. Ever, ever guys think about prison break.
Yeah, I bet. Noise, yeah, Jimmy, I mean, this is the best transgender. It's a really good chance to have a Jimmy who invited these chinese. You know what you want to do with you? 我有一个点子。
如果我们也遭遇类似监控，但是我们的目的。
是那个人要尽可能。
想办法逃出去。失败一次就扣20%的是不是。
一个好主意？
我感觉是他们的反过来的版本，我有点子，如果各位你们愿意看的话，也许我们应该试一试。
有志愿者吗？What if I offer six hundred thousand dollars for them to break out? U.
S dollars. Yeah, yeah, twenty five. Do that. Go for it.
I already know what the largest brand deal on Billy, Billy ever is not covered in that I will do a counter offer. Just a piece of Jimmy. Yeah, you know what? Not inviting them back.
参观完这两个他们正在录制的项目，发现一个很有意思的点，就是他们在参赛人员的选角上花的心思会比想象的多得多。Mr beats告诉我，任何综艺性定制的节目，人真的就是最重要的一点。即便是同样的内容设计，不同的人参与，结果就是完全不一样的。所以选角之上他们相当重视，会花很多的时间面试上百个人。大部分的选角会直接从他们边上的大学面试到合适的大学生来参与这些节目。同时他们拍摄时也会尽可能不干涉参赛人员，所以现场会布置大量这种无干扰式的全景PTZ摄像机，可以远程的遥控来保留真实的节目效果。当然除了前自己的一些选角还有拍摄，你应该会很好奇他们的后期还有制片流程是什么样的对吧？所以他也带我们去了后期制作部门，还有制片部门参观了一圈。
Alright, so you keep the tour going. Let's put like five people and there are five in here, and then we'll just shuttle, okay, a little quicker. okay?
I don't anyone who doesn't make it, they'll drive it back and pick up more of you. What is I? Hold on.
Not sure if this is gonna you? sure? okay?
Oh, I, we're good. All right. We are all .
proud of it.
We haven't lost anyone yet. Do I get a studio tour when I come to china? Yes, please, I will give it a tour. Yeah, we should use these more in the tortoise makes it more fun so far. Okay, let me, I didn't show you guys this at the start of the tour.
This is an, uh, common thing in america, but at the start is kind of annoying, like haven't a block and unlock doors manually and stuff. So for us, what we do is we just have an app on everyone's phone, so you really just walk up to a wave. And then when it does that, just online, which is great because we have four hundred employees.
And so now we can just assign access remove axis, and that's on every single door in this building. Yeah, all right. Next up i'm gonna show.
You guys have we editor videos? Yes, please. How many editors? Well, we're about to find out.
Okay, I don't know if they went home already. All right, right over here. Come through this door. We have a bunch of different rooms that are editors work in. This is just one of them. Come on in and then, honey boys, so how can I do you mind if, yeah, this is the intro.
one of our videos coming up where Jimmy goes to the temples for a hundred hours? Yeah, so we spent a .
hundred hours in ancient temples. Yeah, this is gonna be the next video. We upload the next video. Okay.
okay. So this timeline right here has forty two audio layers. But on these games, when we had a thousand cameras that had over two thousand audio tracks.
how do you figure out the go on each person?
okay. Well, for this, it's really simple because we can audit everything and figure it all out. But for stuff, these games, some of it was literally based on probability, on what audio did we happen to stumble upon.
Here's a fun fact. You can only listen to five people talk at the same time. I tried to do six. That's where it falls off.
Five is good.
If you got a six person there, you don't know what's going on anymore. So but yeah.
and how many editors are on the project for these games?
So it started off at a small, smaller and we weren't doing it. We weren't going fast enough by the end.
I think we have one hundred just.
uh, it was ridiculous. Yeah, it was massive team. Everyone was grinding because it was. That is, by technicality, the most advanced premier project ever attended by mankind. That project .
would .
be successful. yeah. So it was .
ridiculous. But I mean that whatever hundreds of thousands of hours of footage, that was just one episode and there's ten what name one show that has a thousand cameras rolling for dozens of hours each?
Yeah and so after we did that, these videos became a lot simpler by comparison, you know and yeah, I likes you in forty two layers of audio that makes it a lot easier done .
if you full screen this and show me a clip of it. Is this the intro? Yeah, this is the working address.
They're still working on it.
But of the two thousand year old agency, and so far, we're so high. Now let's go see what we can find in this video. We're going to be expLoring dozens of the ancient temples, all of which hide ancient mind secrets from the world, deep underground.
Everything you guys are seeing now, the minds didn't want us to see. Nobody gets to go where we're going, including expLoring one of the seven wonders of the world. But we only have one hundred hours to make discoveries.
The undiscovered in stairs are huge. Yeah, I want to find an escalator. Let's go discover the secrets. Otherwise, what do you think of that? Now in fact, that's incredible. And the fact that, I mean, how do you see that? And I go, all right, I got to watch it.
So one thing that's gonna be really cool in this video is Jimmy walks village, and we're going to restore it to what it originally looked like. So like the buildings will erupt out of the ground and you'll see people walking around and all the artwork will so cool.
Yeah, that monkey scene, because I was just doing the intro and it just started screeching, and I would literally out of just have it. I turned out what and I was like, I can't say that. Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, you cut it. Well, I got to the point where they were doing full on objectives.
Today's objective is to make the monkey stop screaming. How do you guys collaborate though?
Like I think different editors.
So we use premier productions, which is basically like google docs for premier and basically multiple editors. A few of them are working from home. At this very second, we'll have four or five editors collaborating at once on different seeds.
And basically, i'll go in between and we'll check on everyone's scene, make sure it's a lining on the same vision for what we have played on the Whiteboard, which you guys can see behind you but probably don't want a film. And yeah, it's just constantly refining and make sure everyone's on the same page and then we'll put it all together, see if it still makes sense. Most of the time needs to be changed. We'll just keep refining and refining and refining until we're up against all the time where we need to show Jimmy. And hopefully.
by then, it's pretty good. What if, like there's one video that misses your expectations once you watch the first egg copy, uh, then I just have them redo it. Would it be like mad? No, I would have been mad.
I would just be like, hey, it's not good. Those who do it, I mean, sometimes we edit a video of twenty seventh thirty times, just redo everything like completely to redo it. I mean, it is what it is. We're not going to upload something bad.
其实不仅仅是重检，以及他们10到20分钟的节目，可能需要同时六个剪辑减少4到6个礼拜。而且节目上传之后，团队的工作也没有什么没有结束。Mr base这里还会有专门的数据分析师，以前是金融机构的，来跟踪节目的表现。比如哪里观众跳出率最高，具体可以精确到哪几秒钟，看节目里面到底讲了什么，发生了什么导致了这一次流失。
在内容创作之上，他们永远坚持是先做封面和标题再来做内容。因为如果封面和标题不吸引人，那观众就不会点进来看。这是很简单的一个问题，但是往往会被人忽视。他们甚至会有个实力所有人的小组专门来设计封面。一个视频他们会先选出50个封面和标题，通过投流跑数据再来选出最好的冠军封面。甚至一年前的视频，他们也会一直追踪数据，不断的去测试和更换封面。通过这个策略，哪怕是过期的视频播放量也还能增长1000万。
同时在前期调研之上，他们也很谨慎。每一期节目固定有200万美金的制作预算，有专门划分的制片小组来做可行性分析。每个制片团队大概是五个制片人加一位leader。当创意团队给到他们创意之后，制片组就需要把这个拆解成一个叫做core mission核心任务的这么一个列表。只有核心任务被解决，节目才能够正确的落地。比如要去我们要探险，核心任务就是要找到允许拍摄的古庙，而不是古庙里面怎么加分或者加多少，这都没有比较重要。
So as production, part of our responsibility .
is we .
try to never, this is a big thing. We try to never say no. We try to go, oh, I would love to give you that.
I might not be able to give you that, but we can give you this. So it gets this real collaborative effort that's going across. And I think that's what cultivates the relationship to get the best product.
And this is where we actually will take whatever is delivered from the creative team, be a framework or some type of idea or a conception feasibility. Can it actually be done? How much it would cost that? So we build up our budgets and then you can see things on the board is actually how it goes about being created.
Alright, thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for letting us surround you on this wall.
These are all our voice actors. Wow, this is my bedroom. I don't know if you care to see a boat.
Okay, if you want to see it, this is my bedroom. Why is there a person in the unit? Okay, he's just working at the desk.
okay. And then yeah, we'll end it off in here. Wow, we came back and now we're back in the conference room to wrap this all up.
When I come to china, you guys go to show me your own. Oh, sure. Yeah, Jimmy.
All right. If there's enough comments on these videos, i'll come visit. Should I live stream like speed did?
这次看下来，我不知道你的感受是什么样的。就是我觉得硬件什么的，其实我没有什么特别羡慕的地方。我最羡慕的还是他们每一个点都能打的很正确，然后持续产出超级爆款。因为这个并且还能带来一个正向的商业收益，这个循环真的非常厉害。参观下来我发现他们公司虽然不存在所谓的真正意义上的秩序和规章制度，但是他们有着非常完善的内容创作流程。无论是前期调研拍摄还是后期剪辑数据跟踪都有过严密的思考。
我总结了一下，就是一个内容团队或者一个个人内容创作者要做好一件事情，必须有三个步骤。第一，正确的立项方向必须是对的。第二，项目中期的纠错，一定要能够把它给揪到你当初预期的这个方向，不能随便就让它继续就发生了。第三就是之后的复盘，防止犯一样的错误。这三点能够做到不断的循环，我相信内容一定能够约束也好，所以这对我们来说很有帮助。希望你能对你有些启发，也能从miss base的工作流里面学到一些有用的知识，那就是最好的。我们下次见。
